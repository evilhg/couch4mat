%% COUCH4MAT: CouchDB Matlab tbox
%
% Jonas Almeida, April 2010
%
% This manual was generated automatically by running pub.m .
%
% The couch tbox revolves around a data structure and a single command.
% The data structure can be created by just pointing the command to a a URL
% where CouchDB is installed. If no URL is provided then the command
% assumes you are targetting a local deployment, and will use
% localhost:5984.
%
% All CouchDB functionalities are coded under the couch command with one
% exception - the JSON parsers. These two parsers, json2mat and mat2json,
% collectively designated as json4mat (http://json4mat.googlecode.com).
%
%% Installation
%
% You can download couch for the different OSs from
% http://couchdb.apache.org/   or   from http://www.couch.io/downloads.
%
% In addition to Matlab this tutorial also assumes you have CURL installed.
% 
% If you are running on Windows you can get it from http://curl.haxx.se/,
% if you are running this on a Mac or Linux you probably already have it.
%
%% couch()
% Lets start by calling the local deployment, you can also target and
% arbitrary deployment by using the URL as the input argument, i.e.
% couch('url goes here')
c=couch
% this structure, c, will now be used as teh input argument of coucDB() to
% which we will add more arguments.
%
%% Create database
% The name of the database you want to create can be passed directly in the
% c structure at c.db.name or can be sent as a third input argument, which
% we'll do here:
c=couch(c,'create db','mydb')
%% List all databases
% As with other usages of couch we'll use arguments that are as close as
% possible to CouchDB's own syntax. For example, to get a list of all
% databases one would call [c.url,'/_all_dbs'] so the second argument, and
% field in the updated c structure, is 'all_dbs':
c=couch(c,'all_dbs')
%% Insert a document
% the document can be provided already as a JSON string
[c,doc]=couch(c,'insert doc','{"hello":"world"}');
% or as a structured variable, which can include additional fields
lala.hello='world';lala.randM=rand(5);[c,doc]=couch(c,'insert doc',lala)
% note that the response in c.cURL has all the details of the exchange,
c.cURL
% including the _id and _rev of the document
c.cURL.json
% which is evertheless returned as a seccond output argument, doc. If only
% one output argument is specified that will be doc
doc=couch(c,'insert doc',lala);
% see "Doc output argument" section for more on this
%% List all docs
% as with 'all_dbs' but now for documents of a database
c=couch(c,'all_docs');c.db.all_docs
%and each row will contain the key/value returned by that minimalist view
c.db.all_docs.rows(:)
%% Get one doc
% lets get the last document inserted using its _id
id = c.db.all_docs.rows(end).id
% and now restrive the entry
[c,doc]=couch(c,'get doc',id)
% doc comes out as the second output argument of couch(). If you only
% provide one output argument coucj will assume it is doc such that you can

randM=doc.randM
%% Delete one document
% CouchDB will want to make sure you want to delete and entry by asking for
